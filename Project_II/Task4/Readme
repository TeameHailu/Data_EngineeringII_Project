Task 4: Splitting and merging operations with
Apache Pulsar
In this task, we are going to demonstrate how apache pulsar can be used for splitting and
merging of operations. 
Conversion.py file which demonstrates a code that has a
“conversion” operation applied to each word on a string. Here we assume that the operation can
only be applied on a single word instead of the entire string. Based on this premise, you are
required to complete the following sub-tasks:
1. Identify an issue with the current implementation in terms of handling big data i.e., words
are in the order of millions.
2. Redesign the current implementation by using apache pulsar to demonstrate splitting
and merging of data i.e., how the same operation on each word (i.e., splitting) and the
resultant string (i.e., merging) can be handled by consumers and producers. Provide a
diagram to demonstrate how your architecture will look like i.e.,
a. How data splitting and merging is handled by consumer and producer
b. Label broker, consumer and producer.
3. Provide an implementation (preferably in Python programming language) of your
architecture with Apache Pulsar. You can set up your architecture on a single virtual
machine by creating different sessions for each consumer and producer.
