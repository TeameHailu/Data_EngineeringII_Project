This project covers contextualization and orchestration for distributed applications. The assignment
consists of three tasks.
Task 1: covers basic introduction of the Docker environment.
Task 2: requires a reasonably firm understanding of the Docker environment, Dockerfile settings and construction of a multi-container
environment using docker-compose (one of the essential tools to build, connect
and run multiple containers).
Task 3: is a theoretical task that requires a literature survey of different orchestration and contextualization frameworks, theoretical
understanding of their architectures and reflection on gains and challenges related
to the frameworks.
